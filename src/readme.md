Service
https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services

Services Purposes: services handle tasks unrelated to the view or application logic, such as data fetching, input validation, or logging. 

Services Characteristics:
- Services often encapsulate business logic or functionality that can be shared across different components or modules in an application.
- Services may handle tasks like data retrieval, manipulation, or communication with external resources.
- Examples include RESTful API services, database services, or any other service-oriented component in an application.


Utility Purpose: A utility file, on the other hand, usually contains code that provides general-purpose functions or helper methods that can be used across different parts of the application.

Utility Characteristics:
- Utilities often consist of functions that perform common tasks, such as string manipulation, date formatting, or mathematical operations.
- They are not tied to a specific business logic or service but are designed to be reusable across various parts of the application.
- Utilities contribute to code organization, maintainability, and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
