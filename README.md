<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This chrome extention aims to provide users with a unique tool to manage their job search. Searching for a job can be difficult, especially when trying to navigate between many different interfaces and job boards. This extention for Chrome will keep track of jobs that you apply to across many different supported sites, indicating that you have already applied to a job, even when using a different job board. This indication is given to the user in the form of a checkmark next to the job that the user has applied for on a different (or the same) site. Additionally, users are able to customize their experience within the options menu.

##### Noteable Features:
* Configurable settings
* Storage of applied jobs
* Cross-site compatability between different job boards

##### Supported Sites:
* LinkedIn
* Indeed

This extention is still in development and subject to change.
