## New To Project

To get an overview of the project, read the README file. Here is the list of tools you need to install before starting out:

- [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Install Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)

> **_NOTE:_** You have to generate the output folder, and use it to unpack as chrome extension. To build the project, you can go to terminal and type: ```pnpm install``` -> ```pnpm run build```


Please load unpacked the output folder, instead of src folder!

## Getting Started

|   |    
|   |_ utils                -> Reusable utility functions, such as pure functions
|   |   |_ isDuplicate.js   -> Check for duplicates
|   |
|   |_ contentScript.js     -> Script for interacting with webpage/DOM elements
|   |_ popup.js             -> Script for popup
|   |_ serviceWorker.js     -> Asynchronous script worked on another thread
|
|_ .gitignore               -> Specifies files that should be ignored when pushed to GitHub
|_ webpack.config.js        -> Webpack setting file
|_ package.json             -> Project settings, including scripts and dependencies

```

## Note on Webpack configuration


Webpack is a popular JavaScript module bundler. Webpack is commonly used to bundle and manage dependencies in web development projects. Let's break down the key parts of this webpack configuration file:

```
const path = require("path");
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    popup: "./src/popup.js",
    serviceWorker: "./src/serviceWorker.js",
    contentScript: "./src/contentScript.js",
  },
  output: {
    filename: "[name].js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "output"),
  },
  watch: true,
  plugins: [
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [{ from: "static" }],
    }),
  ],
  mode: "development",
  devtool: "inline-source-map"
};
```

1. Entry Points:

- entry: This specifies the entry points for the application. In this setting, there are three entry points: popup, serviceWorker, and contentScript. These are the starting points where Webpack will begin its bundling process.

2. Output:

- output: This specifies the output configuration for the bundled files. In this setting, the bundled files will be named after their corresponding entry points (popup.js, serviceWorker.js, contentScript.js) and will be placed in the "output" directory.

3. Watch Mode:

- watch: This is set to true, enabling watch mode. In watch mode, Webpack will keep running in the background, monitoring the source files for changes. When changes are detected, it will automatically recompile the code.

4. Plugins:

- CopyWebpackPlugin: This is a plugin used to copy files or directories from one location to another during the build process. In this case, it is configured to copy files from the "static" directory to the output directory. This is useful for moving static assets like images or HTML files.

5. Mode:

- mode: This sets the mode for Webpack. In this configuration, it's set to "development." The mode determines certain optimizations and settings appropriate for the specified environment. In development mode, the output code is not minified, and additional debugging information is included.

6. Source Maps: 

- devtool: This specifies the type of source maps to generate. In this case, it's set to "inline-source-map." Source maps help in debugging by mapping the bundled code back to the original source code. The "inline-source-map" option includes the source map as a data URL within the bundled JavaScript file.
